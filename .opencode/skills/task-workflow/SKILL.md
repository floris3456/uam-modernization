# Task workflow

Use this skill whenever a delegated task starts, resumes, changes approach, hands off, or finalizes.

An exact-SHA `developer` to `main` promotion after explicit human approval is not a task under this lifecycle. It must not create or update task-progress or add a pre-promotion handoff commit; use `git-sync-and-handoff`'s promotion procedure instead.

## Start

1. Confirm the task ID and that the current branch is `developer`.
2. Confirm the working tree is clean and synchronized with `origin/developer`.
3. Create `docs/work/current/<task-id>-<slug>.md` from `docs/work/templates/task-progress-template.md` before substantive work.
4. Copy the exact **public-safe delegated brief** into `Original task brief` without rewriting it.
5. Record the task-start `developer` SHA in the file.
6. Load `implementation-records` before changing an implemented component or an accepted planned fact.
7. Load `git-sync-and-handoff` before any commit or return of control.

Stop and ask through the limited response if the delegated text appears unsafe for public Git persistence.

## Maintain task-progress

Keep the file useful after compaction or agent replacement. Update:

- `Current objective` when steering changes the route but not the general human goal.
- `Current position` with the exact working point.
- `Observed` with direct results only.
- `Interpretation` with developer inference, never disguised as fact.
- `Attempts` with enough detail to avoid repeating a failed route.
- `Changed approach` for material strategy changes, including steering source and treatment of old work.
- `Checks`, `Blockers / required decisions`, `Remaining work`, `Next action`, and `Relevant durable records`.

Do not record private chain-of-thought, credentials, private chat, or unnecessary sensitive values.

## Attempt record

For a meaningful failed route, record:

- approach;
- relevant action/check;
- observable result;
- whether abandoned; and
- reusable lesson.

Do not label an event a “substantive Luna attempt.” The web orchestrator makes that classification.

## Steering

Continue in the same task file when the orchestrator changes implementation strategy while preserving the same general goal. Record the change under `Changed approach`. Use a new task only when the intended outcome materially changes.

For pushed work, prefer a corrective commit or `git revert`; do not rewrite shared history.

## Compaction recovery

Recover in this order:

1. Original task brief.
2. Current objective.
3. Current position.
4. Remaining work.
5. Next action.
6. Referenced AS-BUILT/deviation records.
7. Exact current `developer` repository state.
8. Attempts/changed approach only as needed.
9. Resume.

AS-BUILT explains what exists. Task-progress explains what you were doing.

## Handoff boundary

When returning control:

1. finish the bounded activity;
2. make implementation records current;
3. update task-progress completely;
4. load `git-sync-and-handoff`;
5. create the dedicated handoff snapshot commit;
6. push it successfully; and
7. return only the five-field response.

## Finalization

Only after the web orchestrator approves substantive implementation:

1. reconcile actual implementation with AS-BUILT, deviations, design, and other durable records;
2. promote any durable task-only information to its correct home;
3. remove temporary procedural residue;
4. delete the task-progress file;
5. commit and push finalization; and
6. use the finalization task-record wording defined by `git-sync-and-handoff`.

Finalization is a reconciliation pass, not deferred documentation. If it exposes substantive implementation errors or requires product code changes, restore/recreate the task record and return to normal implementation.
