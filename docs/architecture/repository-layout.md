The ChatGPT Project developer instructions and Project skills are deliberately **not** stored in this repository. The independent `web-orchestration` branch contains only `web-orchestration-only/**` and is not part of the normal implementation tree.

## Placement rules

| Change | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Active task process | `docs/work/current/<task>.md` |
| Current implemented component facts | `src/<component>/AS-BUILT.md` or the component's established AS-BUILT location |
| Planned-versus-actual difference | applicable milestone/component deviation record |
| Architecture authority/branch model | `docs/architecture/` |
| Human gate evidence | `docs/milestones/` |
| Conditional local agent procedure | `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Repeatable command | `scripts/` or `tools/` |
| Source evidence | existing immutable evidence root; never rewrite |

## Cleanup

Remove obsolete agents, skills, templates, scripts, validators, and active references together. Do not preserve old agent-system chronology in current architecture records. Do not add empty product frameworks before their milestone.
