# Agent system

## Purpose

The system separates human acceptance, web orchestration, remote evidence, and local implementation without duplicating the full operating prompt in the repository.

## Authority

1. The human defines consequential intent and decides whether an exact reviewed state enters `main`.
2. Remote Git is authoritative repository evidence.
3. The web orchestrator independently reasons about and reviews that evidence.
4. Developer responses and task-progress are navigation and developer reasoning, not proof.
5. jCodeMunch is scouting context only.

## Web orchestrator

The ChatGPT Project is the primary reasoning, task-design, routing, steering, and review layer. Its developer instructions and conditional skills live in the ChatGPT Project, not this repository.

In MCP-ON mode it uses:

- connected GitHub MCP for exact remote evidence and narrow `web-orchestration` writes;
- jCodeMunch MCP for code-symbol scouting; and
- opencode-mcp for implementation delegation.

In MCP-OFF mode it uses the public GitHub website for repository inspection and cannot pretend delegation or direct orchestration writes occurred.

## Local implementation

The current approved implementation agents are:

- `small-developer`: default, configured-provider GPT 5.6 Luna at `max` reasoning effort;
- `large-developer`: exceptional path, configured-provider GPT 5.6 Sol at `high` reasoning effort.

The web orchestrator chooses the agent. Local developers do not launch subagents, review their own work, select escalation, or accept changes.

Routing policy is web-side and intentionally is not frozen through a validator that counts agent files.

## Branches

- `developer`: active implementation and task-progress.
- `main`: exact implementation deliberately accepted by the human.
- `web-orchestration`: independent orphan-style tree containing only `web-orchestration-only/**`.

No normal merge crosses between `web-orchestration` and implementation branches.

## Scouting runtime

jCodeMunch is non-authoritative symbol scouting. Project configuration uses strict freshness with a 15-second wait ceiling and excludes evidence, research, archives, and retired local handoffs to improve relevance and minimize indexed data. A timeout may still return the previous index, so freshness must be checked before relying on scouting after edits.

The current machine-local summarizer configuration was observed on 2026-08-08 to send non-excluded symbol signatures/context to a remote DeepSeek service through OpenCode Go. Its documented zero-data-retention condition was time-limited through 2026-08-31 and must be re-evaluated before then. Credentials and machine service configuration remain outside Git.

## Persistent continuity

- The local developer's task-progress file survives compaction, reconnects, multiple commits, steering, and Luna-to-Sol transition.
- AS-BUILT is live implementation memory and durable reality.
- Deviation records are live intended-versus-actual truth.
- The web orchestrator keeps concise task context and routing records on `web-orchestration` when MCP-ON write capability is available.

## Validation boundary

Mechanical checks establish parseability, path/reference integrity, executable bits, templates, hook prerequisites, and other deterministic facts. They do not claim to prove implementation quality, AS-BUILT truth, deviation completeness, substantive attempts, or escalation judgment.
